# package.json
- project metadata (name, authors, license)
- describes projects
- lists dependencies

# package-lock.json
- records the exact versions that were installed
- Package.json can be loose in its specification of dependency version (^, ~)
- recommended to check this file into source control
- helpful if you need to re-create the exact dependency versions in your project

# package version
Version numbers in npm are parsed by a component called semver.
major.minor.patch
version modifiers: ~, ^
package >= 1.2.7 : install any pckage greater than 1.2.7
package ~1.2.3 : install patch level changes (1.2.3, 1.2.4, but not 1.3.x nor 2.x)
package ^1.2.3 : insdtall minor updates (1.2.3, 1.2.4, 1.5.6, but not 2.x)
@ indicates version tag
