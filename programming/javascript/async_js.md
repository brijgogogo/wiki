* [[event_loop]]

# asynchronous operations example:
- network I/O, waiting for response from server
- database access
- user input


# mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations:
1. [[callback_function]]
2. [[promises]]
3. [[event_emitters]]
4. [[reactive_programming]]
5. [[async_functions]]


== Promises ==
Provides a single future value
Not Cancellable

== Observable ==

Cancellable
Supports map, filter, reduce operators
