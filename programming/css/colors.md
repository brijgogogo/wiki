# color scheme
- Accent color : used as the background for page elements such as call-to-action buttons and text that you want to make sure the reader doesn't miss. As such, it should be a bold, unmistakable hue that stands out.
- Secondary color : used as the background for some of the content bands. It should be similar to accent color: bold enough to tell the reader that the content is important but not so bold that it clashes with or overshadows the accent color
- Tertiary color : used as background for content that's less important
