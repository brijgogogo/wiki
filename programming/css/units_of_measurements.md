= units of measurements =
 - pixel (px) : absolute measurement, 1/96 of an inch
 - point (pt) : absolute measurement, 1/2 of an inch
 - em : relative measurement equal to the element's default, inherited, or defined font size
 - root em (rem) : relative measurement equal to the font size of the root element of the web page
 - viewport width (vw) : relative measurement equal to 1/100 of the current width of the browser window
 - viewport height (vh): relative measurement equal to 1/100 of the current height of the browser window

# Root element is html element. Automatically assigned browser's default size (usually 16px) or the type size set by the user in the browser's preferences.

Modern designs use rem to scale well on different size of devices and honoring user preferences.
