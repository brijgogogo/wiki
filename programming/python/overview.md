= python =
Python was created in the 1990s by Guido van Rossum.
high-level, dynamic, object-oriented, cross-platform

features
* interpreted
* dynamic programming language
* automatic memory management
* readable
* .py extensions
* platform independent
* maintained by Python Software Foundation
* open source (is free)
* www.python.org

Standard Library: representing data, processing text, interacting with the OS, file system, web programming
Extension modules: GUI, databases, networks, xml parsing

Extension module can be written in Python or lower-level languages to achieve maximum performance.
Python 3 is incompatible with Python 2


== development environments: ==
* IDLE (Python shell) : comes with Python, based on Tkinter GUI toolkit
sudo pacman -S tk
extensions: IdleX
* Eclipse : PyDev extension
* Wingware IDE
* PyCharm
* Visual Studio : PTVS plug-in

== tools ==
* Pyflakes
* PyLint : check style details
*

script : a file that you can run directly
module: a file that you can import
A file can be both a script and a script.
In v2, compiled bytecode file for each module is saved in the same directory with name as basename and extension .pyc (or .pyo if generated by python -o)
In v3, compiled bytecode is saved in __pycache__ directory in directory of module source. It uses version-specific extension (denoting optimization level).
Python saves bytecode files only for modules you import.

On Unix system, to make file directly executable, grant x and r permissions and use shebang ling:
#! /usr/bin/env python



python/python.exe (Windows): Python interpretor, compiler
$ python hello.py
$ python -h : help
$ python -V : show version
$ python -c "print('hello');"
$ python
>>> print('hello world!')
starts interactive session, _ (underscore) contains result of last expression.
Terminate with C-Z or C-D
