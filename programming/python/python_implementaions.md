= Python Implementations =

Python Language - specification that defines a set of rules and grammer for writting Python code
Python Implementation - program that understands those rules and can execute Python code


implementations:
* [[CPython]] (default implementaion)
* [[Jython]] (written in Java)
* [[IronPython]] (written in C#)
* [[PyPy]] (written in subset of Python itself)
* Pyston
*


Ideally all implementations should be able to run Python code. Certain features may be available in one implementation and not other or they may behave differently.
