# Its All Invented
A simple way to practice it’s all invented is to ask yourself this question:
  What assumption am I making,
  That I’m not aware I’m making,
  That gives me what I see?
 
And when you have an answer to that question, ask yourself this one:
  What might I now invent,
  That I haven’t yet invented,
  That would give me other choices?
 
And then you can invent spaces, like the paper surrounding the nine dots, where four lines can do the work of five.

# universe of possibility
  How are my thoughts and actions, in this moment, reflections of the measurement world?
 
You look for thoughts and actions that reflect survival and scarcity, comparison and competition, attachment and anxiety.
You keep asking the question until you finally appreciate how hopeless it is to escape being shaped by the assumptions that underlie all of life.

# Giving an A
THE PRACTICE OF giving the A both invents and recognizes a universal desire in people to contribute to others, no matter how many barriers there are to its expression.
