Untrack files already added to git repository based on .gitignore
http://www.codeblocq.com/2016/01/Untrack-files-already-added-to-git-repository-based-on-gitignore/
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m '.gitignore fix'



This will unstage all files you might have staged with git add:
git reset

This will revert all local uncommitted changes (should be executed in repo root):
git checkout .

You can also revert uncommitted changes only to particular file or directory:
git checkout [some_dir|file.txt]

Yet another way to revert all uncommitted changes (longer to type, but works from any subdirectory):
git reset --hard HEAD

This will remove all local untracked files, so only git tracked files remain:
git clean -fdx
WARNING: -x will also remove all ignored files, including ones specified by .gitignore! You may want to use -n for preview of files to be deleted.

* git checkout <fileName>
restore a file from the index

* git-clean
Remove untracked files from the working tree
If any optional <path>... arguments are given, only those paths are affected.
Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the -x option is specified, ignored files are also removed.
-d Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. 
-f or --force
-n or --dry-run
-x : don't use ignore rules
-X : remove only ignored files

* git diff <fileName>
see changes in file

* git push origin <new_branch>
to push your new branch

* git show-ref

* package version

* take branch from remote
git checkout --track origin/branch_name
from git 1.7 onwards:
git checkout <branchName>

== deleting branch ==
Switch to some other branch and delete Test_Branch, as follows:
$ git checkout master
$ git branch -d Test_Branch
If above command gives you error - The branch 'Test_Branch' is not fully merged. If you are sure you want to delete it and still you want to delete it, then you can force delete it using -D instead of -d, as:
$ git branch -D Test_Branch
To delete Test_Branch from remote as well, execute:
git push origin --delete Test_Branch


== replace-local-branch-with-remote-branch-entirely-in-git ==
That's as easy as three steps:
Delete your local branch: git branch -d local_branch
Fetch the latest remote branch: git fetch origin remote_branch
Rebuild the local branch based on the remote one: git checkout -b local_branch origin/remote_branch

== see changes of a commit ==
git show <COMMIT>

== adding remote ==
git remote add origin http://bsharma@bitbucket.dkpartners.com/scm/mboit/dk.systemsinventory.git
git push -u origin master

== changing remote ==
git remote set-url origin http://git.url
git push -u origin --all
git push origin --tags
